## Description
Write a small program which takes 2 (animal) species and generates a joke containing those 2 species using the OpenAI API.

## Tasks
- Learn setting up and using a decent code repository.
  - *I considered GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, SourceForge. I picked GitHub as the Max SDK is also hosted on GitHub; I expect that development and integration of Max add-ins will be easier if my future repo is hosted on the same platform and hence I want to learn this platform first.*
- Learn OpenAI API.
- Learn REST API.
  - *OpenAI API is implemented in REST, Python and Node.js. I picked REST API so that I can deliver the solution in C/C++. This will let me integrate the solution later on into my Max add-ins (Max SDK is available in C and C++).*
- Refresh my knowledge about developing C++ command-line applications on MacOS.
- Implement a solution.
